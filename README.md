# Thesis: Lymphocyte dynamics

This is the analysis for M. McCown's Honors Thesis at Brigham Young University, "Lymphocyte proteomics for monitoring long term immune system dynamics." 

## Publication
This thesis will be made available through the Harold B. Lee Library, lib.byu.edu, and on  Scholar's Archive at scholarsarchive.byu.edu/

## Repository contents
This repository contains all information, data, and code necessary to replicate the analyses in the manuscript. 

* ~/data - a folder that contains data files or url to data files
* load_data.py - a python script containing all code required for parsing data files and loading them into data frames.
* figure1_design.png - the image file for Figure 1, a graphic figure showing the design, that was created using BioRender.com
* figure2_venn.ipynb - a jupyter notebook that contains all code used in the venn diagram, shown in the manuscript as Figure 2, that demonstrates a strong shared protein profile.
* figure3_correlations.ipynb - a jupyter notebook containing the code used in generating Figure 3, showing correlation coefficients to illustrate the time dependent change.
* figure4_change_profile.ipynb - a jupyter notebook containing the code to make Figure 4, showing differentially expressed proteins a) between B cells at each time point and b) between B and T cells.

* data.md  explains how data files in the repository relate to the supplemental tables from the manuscript
* data_descriptor.ipynb demonstrates how to use the methods in load_data.py, and describes the resulting dataframes.
* LICENSE.md
* README.md
